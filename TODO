TODO
----
 * Refactor logging, i.e. get rid of logging config file. Let users configure the path where, that's all. Do the rest programatically
 * Modularize unit tests
 * New tests for url escaping
 * More testing against IIIF validation service once Stanford makes a test jp2 available
 * Work with other formats. Loris#on_get_image should resolve the identifier and then figure out which conversion method to call
 * So, the resolver needs to return not just a path to the image, but the format as well
 * Need a way to pre-bake the cache and then persist the cache for huge images.
 * Once everything is json based (in 1.1) consider Mongo as an optional cache.
 * Diagram cache flow

Questions
---------
 * Ingest (or make it possible to put an encoded/escaped URL in the identifier slot)
 * Is Werkzeug still the right framework? Tornado?
