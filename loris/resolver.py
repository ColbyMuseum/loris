		Given the identifier of an image, get the path (fp) and format. This 
		will likely	need to be reimplemented overridden to suit different 
		environments and can be as smart or dumb as you want.
		
		For this dumb version a constant path is prepended to the identfier 
		supplied to get the path It assumes this 'identifier' ends with a file 
		extension from which the format is then derived.

		For other formats you'll also need to implement a static constructor for
		ImgInfo to get what it needs from that format, i.e. ImgInfo.from_myformat().

		Args:
			The identifier for the image.
		Returns:
			two tuple: (fp, format)
		Raises:
			ResolverException when something goes wrong...
